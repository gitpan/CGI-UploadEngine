CGI-UploadEngine version 0.9.2

CGI::UploadEngine allows server administrators to easily enable file upload for 
any perl application or developer. The upload "engine" has a simple API that not 
only builds the necessary HTML but also validates (and optionally limits) the 
file type, size, and destination directory.
